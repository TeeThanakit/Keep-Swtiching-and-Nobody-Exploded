INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net G/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin G/led_reg[10]_i_1/O, cell G/led_reg[10]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
